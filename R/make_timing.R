#' @title Construct a \code{timing} object
#' @description Construct a \code{timing} object controlling the timing and frequencies for navigation, making sure about the consistency and feasibility of provided information.
#' @param nav.start Time at which navigation starts
#' @param nav.end Time at which navigation ends
#' @param freq.imu Frequency of generated IMU data (and hence that of navigation)
#' @param freq.gps Frequency of generated GPS data
#' @param freq.baro Frequency of generated Baro data
#' @param gps.out.start Time at which GPS outage starts
#' @param gps.out.end Time at which GPS outage ends
#' @return An object of class \code{timing} containing sensor name and its additive error model along with the frequency associated to that model
